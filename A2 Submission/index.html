<p>Student ID – s3987670</p>
<p>Student Email - s3987670@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
I was born in 1990 and currently reside in Eaton, Western Australia. I’ve always loved the IT industry; it’s always been something that seems to come naturally to me. I’ve developed a passion with Smart home devices and scenes/automation scenarios to really assist with everyday living. My hobbies include Gardening and Binge-watching TV series. My experience in the IT sector is mostly from self-taught troubleshooting, I also worked for a JB HiFi Store when I was younger as an IT salesman, working my way up to management and even opening up 2 new stores from the ground up.</P>
<p>Almost 6 years ago now, I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes. Due to such a late diagnosis, I sustained multiple health complications that are associated with long periods of time with excessively high sugar levels. The main one being peripheral neuropathy in both feet and legs.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">Bisharo Ahmed Muse</h3>
<p>Student Num: s3997742</p>
<p>Email: s3997742@strudent.rmit.edu.au </p>
<p>My name is Bisharo Ahmed. I was in Somalia, and I moved to Australia with my family in 2012, but before that, I lived in Malaysia for four years, and to be honest, it was the best four years of my life. I am the youngest in my family. I speak 2 languages fluently, English and Somali, and hopefully sometime in the future I am planning to study a third language (French). I have always been fascinated by the French language. I work full-time at CHW, so my life is boring and busy, on the weekend I usually spend time with my family and friends or just by myself. </p>
<p>My interest in Information Technology: it started when I finished high school. I did not know what I wanted to do with my life or what career to go into. I have tried fashion design, beauty therapist and but none of them felt right, and I had this feeling that I was not on the right career path. My aunt used to tell me to do IT (Information Technology) courses all the time, so in 2018 I enrolled myself in Information Technology Certificate III at Tafe and I ended up finishing to Diploma. I fell in love with it. I am doing this course now to refresh my memory since I have not studied in a while, and I am planning to go back to university to finish my degree. </p>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">Katya De Francesch</h3>
<p>Student number: s3998036 </p>
<p>I am Australian, I was born in Perth in 1997 of Italian/Croatian background. I speak English, I learnt Italian at school, currently picking it back up on an app (Duolingo), I can’t speak fluently, but I know the basics. I have played netball since I was 8 years old, have a Pomeranian x shih tzu dog named Snickers and I am currently 2IC at a dental clinic. </p>
<p>IT is where the world is heading, to be knowledgeable in this field to me is like having a superpower. I love helping people and making their lives easier, especially when it comes to my grandparents, they always come to me for their technological needs, and I love that I can help them and make their lives easier. I want to be able to unlock all that I can in the IT world to help those around me by optimising their lives as best as I can and to achieve the most out of life that I can. As far as experience goes, I would say I’m no more equipped in the field of IT than any other 25-year-old who grew up with technology. I know how to use a smart phone and I can use a computer basically. My partner works in IT as a manager at Deloitte, I would say he’s been a bit of an inspiration into my enrolment in this course. He is currently building his own CRM system as a side business, and I would love nothing more than to be able to assist him with that as I know he needs the help. </p>

<p>Hello, my name is Willem MacNamara, and I was born and raised in Malaysia. Currently, I am living in Melbourne, Australia, and pursuing an IT career, with a focus on web development and possibly Web3. In my free time, I enjoy participating in various sports such as badminton, mountain biking, dirt biking, futsal, and occasionally going for long runs. </p>
<p> I am currently working in retail as a senior manager in logistics, and my work schedule varies from 4 to 6 days a week depending on the stock we receive. My interest in technology, specifically video games and coding, is what inspired me to pursue an IT career. I am fascinated by the complexity and flexibility of coding, and how it impacts our daily lives through devices such as phones and computers. I hope to one day be able to use my skills and knowledge to create something meaningful. </p>

<p>Student number: S3918378 </p>
<p>E-mail: S3918378@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
<p>My name is Kiran, I was born in Australia, my mother is Australian, and my mother is Indian. I have lived overseas in Jakarta, Indonesia for 6 years between 2008 until 2014. From then I completed my HSC in Australia in 2017. I speak fluent English and I can also speak broken Bahasa Indonesian. I really enjoy go-karting and car racing and have a big passion for motorsports, my weekends generally consist of doing things motorsport related.  </p>
<p>My interests in IT vary. I can appreciate any and every avenue that IT specialists choose to pursue. These include programming, cybersecurity, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and technology management and extends to using technology to solve problems in a particular industry, such as healthcare, finance, or education. </p>
<p>Test Results (Refer to GitHub for results) </p>
<p>My test results really show that I am a hands-on type of learner, in other words a kinaesthetic learner. I learn best by doing or participating in hands-on activities. Kinaesthetic learners often prefer to learn through experience and experimentation, rather than through traditional methods such as lectures or reading. </p>

<h1 style="background-color:yellow;">3.Industry Data</h1>
<h3 style="background-color:red;">Clinton Jenkins – ICT Manager </h3>
<p>The Demand for ICT Managers is one of the highest forecasted increases in number of employment positions at 6.2% per year. In 2021 there were 288,851 positions in Australia for this role which is forecasted to grow to 414,160 by 2027.<br>
According to the Burning Glass data, the top 5 IT-specific skill sets that are in the greatest demand are as follows: SQL, JavaScript, JAVA, Microsoft Windows and Project Management. Out of these 5, I’m only experienced with MS Windows and Project Management.<br>
As for the top 5 general skills in demand are Communication skills, Problem solving skills, Organisational skills, Writing skills and Teamwork/Collaboration. Of these highly demanded general skills, I feel as though the Writing skill is not of my strongest skill sets.<br>
It was a combination of the Burning Glass data and the https://labourmarketinsights.gov.au/ website that inspired me to change my ideal job from self-employment options to looking closer into the world of ICT Management.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">Willem MacNamara - Web Developer</h3>
<p>Web Developer is ranked 15th in 2018 compared to other IT jobs, and in 2019 it was ranked 2nd compared to ICT management and Phyton Developer and is reported to grow 23% and 25% for software developers from 2021 to 2031 much faster than the average. Here’s a statistic to see which web developer role is at the top right now:</p>

<p>To succeed as a web developer, one should have a strong foundation in computer literacy, as well as excellent problem-solving skills and attention to detail. Additionally, it is essential to have a good understanding of the key technologies used in web development, such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Other in-demand skills include Python, HTML, CSS, Java, SQL, NoSQL, C#, Rust, Perl, and Go. The ranking of these skills may vary depending on the specific requirements of the employer.</p>
<p>-Python, C, and Java are some of the highly ranked IT-specific skills that are not included in my current skill set for web development.<br>
-	Teamwork and collaboration, oral communication, and written communication are some of the highest-ranked general skills not in my current skill set. </p>
<p>Improving these skills can enhance my chances of success in my future career as a web developer.<br> Here is a diagram that shows what General skills are in demand:</p>

<p>looking at the Burning Glass data and other sources have not changed my opinion but grew my curiosity even more and shows that I have much to learn and a long way to go before I can fully become web developer in the following years.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">IT CADET – Katya De Francesch</h3>
<p>This job wasn’t listed specifically in any of the burning glass data/other websites, but it does sound most similar to Service Desk Analyst (maybe an entry level version of that) which was ranked number 5 on Burning Glass Data’s top IT job titles.</p>
<p>Burning Glass Data’s Top 3 IT Skills are SQL, JavaScript and JAVA which my ideal job doesn’t require. My job does specify needing experience with MS Suite which was ranked number 5 on this list. </p>
<p>Burning Glass Data’s top 3 generic skills are communication skills, problem solving skills and organisational skills. My ideal job requires all of these as you are working with customers and other people within the bank. The job is based on solving people’s technical problems and I would assume all jobs require some form of organisation as you need to be able to organise your own workload and make sure you’re completing tasks in a timely manner. The highest ranked 3 generic skills that my ideal job does not require are writing, creativity (no designing etc involved) and leadership (entry level job).  </p>
<p>After looking at the burning glass data I was surprised that service desk analyst would be ranked so high. The data has solidified my desire to go into this line of work as the generic skills it requires are amongst the highest ranked in the list and are skills that I already possess due to my current work as a manager at a dental clinic. My concern is that I wouldn’t be using many of the highly ranked IT skills so I’m not sure how much I would really learn in this job.</p>

<h1 style="background-color:yellow;">4.IT Work (Individual members reports with links etc)</h1>
<h3 style="background-color:red;">Clinton Jenkins - ICT Manager </h3>
<p>The kind of work done by an ICT Manager varies depending on how big the company is, whether there are other IT workers underneath this role. Generally, they are responsible for all day-to-day IT operations. They maintain, monitor, service and upgrade all sections of a company's IT related infrastructure. While also supporting and managing IT security.  </p>
<p>An ICT Manager ensures a company's successful future and its demand for scalability when upgrading its IT systems. Working with the financial team of a company to keep its IT systems up to date, working out an annual budget, developing cost effective tenders to upgrade a company's tech and submitting these to the appropriate heads of department.  </p>
<p>They are also responsible for all end users of an organisation, creating their login accounts, work emails, setting up their desk with all their required communication devices and displays. AV and media tech equipment for meeting/board rooms (i.e., Projectors with sound etc). </p>
<p>The ICT Manager must interact with everyone in the office. From delegating tasks to subordinates below them, to communicating with all non-IT related staff regarding any troubleshooting issues they may be suffering at the time. They also deal with all IT-related service providers (i.e., Phones, Internet, Cloud networking subscription services, etc). </p>
<p>The ICT Manager will spend a great deal of time at their desk if they’re lucky enough they could even have remote access to majority of a company's infrastructure. Thus, only requiring to be face-to-face for more upfront hands-on type jobs. </p>
<p>Some of their most challenging aspects include prioritizing of incoming day-to-day troubleshooting problems all the while trying to keep up with all other day-to-day maintenance of a company's IT infrastructure.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">Katya - Help desk technician</h3>
<p>A typical day begins with logging in and setting up all of their programs for the day, they are responsible for the support of many systems. I always have at least ten different applications open. They are assigned to take either calls or chats. The work that is done daily is broad. E.g. password resets, how-to’s, break/fix, uninstall/reinstalls or escalations for larger issues as needed.  Their main challenges are content. Working in a support center that handles several different applications can be overwhelming. It takes time to master each app. The learning is continuous. As systems in the company change, new bugs appear. It can be challenging to stay updated.  </p>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">QA tester at Silverchip (software development company):</h3>
<p>They work from home sometimes and sometimes go to the office. A day usually involves catching up on e-mails, looking through reports to prioritise the day. On Mondays they have a stand-up meting to see if any developers have issues or any blockers that need testing after campaign. After checking through the geo board, they work from, any urgent or high priority tickets will be tackled. They also need to check on project deadlines coming up and those will be worked on also. They make sure any work that the developers have is completed and is working as expected from the point of view of an end user for the site making sure there are no issues with functionality/designs/user experience on the site. This is done by working through a predefined acceptance criteria if working on a support ticket or based on the ticket description or project specification if working on a project. </p>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">QA tester: </h3>
<p>The first task of the day is to check if the build and the deploy of the application went well, without any issues or errors. Sometimes they run their builds and deployment by themselves, depending about the builds. The second task of the day is reading emails (bug reports, documentation). From those emails and bug reports, it is determined what is a priority to test. Every task that is assigned needs to be done according in order of priority. Meetings occur daily, and discussions about issues and bug reports are part of daily routine. One of the biggest challenges of a QA tester is not having enough time. You can find many bugs in a full day of testing just one part of an app and become occupied trying to fix it. Another challenge is communicating to the developers why you think a real user is going to behave in a way that is different from what they’ve pictured.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">Software engineer at SoapBox Labs:</h3>
<p>The day starts with checking emails and reviewing monitoring tooling to ensure the Web Services are running smoothly and all the regions are functioning and serving traffic as intended. There are Product-Developer team stand-ups every morning. Then the majority of the day is spent coding (Python, C++, Javascript, Kubernetes, Azure), monitoring, and/or testing (making sure every system is functioning well).  </p>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">Software engineer: </h3>
<p>The day starts with logging into the projects they’re working on, checking their status and planning the day. This also includes supporting other team members or doing code-reviews. In the morning, teams usually have their daily stand-ups, where the progress of the projects are discussed, including any issues that need solving. A big challenge is trying to reach perfection whilst also being realistic. Trying to be perfect can lead to working too many hours trying to tweak things no one else would notice.  </p>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">Data scientist: </h3>
<p>typical day usually includes meetings with the analytics team to discuss the tasks of the day and brainstorm for possible solutions. Then they will start working on the data. Analysing data consists of three main tasks: gathering the data, cleaning the data, and finally processing the data. Gathering data is usually the easiest part. Cleaning the data means going through the data and trying to understand it, making corrections where needed such as moving outliers or data that should not be included. This step can take a lot of time, but understanding the data is crucial to start processing it. The data processing part is where you use programming skills to analyse the work and come up with solutions for the problem.  </p>
