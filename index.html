<p>Student ID – s3987670</p>
<p>Student Email - s3987670@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
I was born in 1990 and currently reside in Eaton, Western Australia. I’ve always loved the IT industry; it’s always been something that seems to come naturally to me. I’ve developed a passion with Smart home devices and scenes/automation scenarios to really assist with everyday living. My hobbies include Gardening and Binge-watching TV series. My experience in the IT sector is mostly from self-taught troubleshooting, I also worked for a JB HiFi Store when I was younger as an IT salesman, working my way up to management and even opening up 2 new stores from the ground up.</P>
<p>Almost 6 years ago now, I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes. Due to such a late diagnosis, I sustained multiple health complications that are associated with long periods of time with excessively high sugar levels. The main one being peripheral neuropathy in both feet and legs.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">Bisharo Ahmed Muse</h3>
<p>Student Num: s3997742</p>
<p>Email: s3997742@strudent.rmit.edu.au </p>
<p>My name is Bisharo Ahmed. I was in Somalia, and I moved to Australia with my family in 2012, but before that, I lived in Malaysia for four years, and to be honest, it was the best four years of my life. I am the youngest in my family. I speak 2 languages fluently, English and Somali, and hopefully sometime in the future I am planning to study a third language (French). I have always been fascinated by the French language. I work full-time at CHW, so my life is boring and busy, on the weekend I usually spend time with my family and friends or just by myself. </p>
<p>My interest in Information Technology: it started when I finished high school. I did not know what I wanted to do with my life or what career to go into. I have tried fashion design, beauty therapist and but none of them felt right, and I had this feeling that I was not on the right career path. My aunt used to tell me to do IT (Information Technology) courses all the time, so in 2018 I enrolled myself in Information Technology Certificate III at Tafe and I ended up finishing to Diploma. I fell in love with it. I am doing this course now to refresh my memory since I have not studied in a while, and I am planning to go back to university to finish my degree. </p>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">Katya De Francesch</h3>
<p>Student number: s3998036 </p>
<p>I am Australian, I was born in Perth in 1997 of Italian/Croatian background. I speak English, I learnt Italian at school, currently picking it back up on an app (Duolingo), I can’t speak fluently, but I know the basics. I have played netball since I was 8 years old, have a Pomeranian x shih tzu dog named Snickers and I am currently 2IC at a dental clinic. </p>
<p>IT is where the world is heading, to be knowledgeable in this field to me is like having a superpower. I love helping people and making their lives easier, especially when it comes to my grandparents, they always come to me for their technological needs, and I love that I can help them and make their lives easier. I want to be able to unlock all that I can in the IT world to help those around me by optimising their lives as best as I can and to achieve the most out of life that I can. As far as experience goes, I would say I’m no more equipped in the field of IT than any other 25-year-old who grew up with technology. I know how to use a smart phone and I can use a computer basically. My partner works in IT as a manager at Deloitte, I would say he’s been a bit of an inspiration into my enrolment in this course. He is currently building his own CRM system as a side business, and I would love nothing more than to be able to assist him with that as I know he needs the help. </p>

<p>My name is Kiran, I was born in Australia, my mother is Australian, and my mother is Indian. I have lived overseas in Jakarta, Indonesia for 6 years between 2008 until 2014. From then I completed my HSC in Australia in 2017. I speak fluent English and I can also speak broken Bahasa Indonesian. I really enjoy go-karting and car racing and have a big passion for motorsports, my weekends generally consist of doing things motorsport related.  </p>
<p>My interests in IT vary. I can appreciate any and every avenue that IT specialists choose to pursue. These include programming, cybersecurity, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and technology management and extends to using technology to solve problems in a particular industry, such as healthcare, finance, or education. </p>
<p>Test Results (Refer to GitHub for results) </p>
<p>My test results really show that I am a hands-on type of learner, in other words a kinaesthetic learner. I learn best by doing or participating in hands-on activities. Kinaesthetic learners often prefer to learn through experience and experimentation, rather than through traditional methods such as lectures or reading. </p>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">Clinton Jenkins – ICT Manager </h3>
<p>The Demand for ICT Managers is one of the highest forecasted increases in number of employment positions at 6.2% per year. In 2021 there were 288,851 positions in Australia for this role which is forecasted to grow to 414,160 by 2027.<br>
According to the Burning Glass data, the top 5 IT-specific skill sets that are in the greatest demand are as follows: SQL, JavaScript, JAVA, Microsoft Windows and Project Management. Out of these 5, I’m only experienced with MS Windows and Project Management.<br>
As for the top 5 general skills in demand are Communication skills, Problem solving skills, Organisational skills, Writing skills and Teamwork/Collaboration. Of these highly demanded general skills, I feel as though the Writing skill is not of my strongest skill sets.<br>
It was a combination of the Burning Glass data and the https://labourmarketinsights.gov.au/ website that inspired me to change my ideal job from self-employment options to looking closer into the world of ICT Management.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">Willem MacNamara - Web Developer</h3>
<p>Web Developer is ranked 15th in 2018 compared to other IT jobs, and in 2019 it was ranked 2nd compared to ICT management and Phyton Developer and is reported to grow 23% and 25% for software developers from 2021 to 2031 much faster than the average. Here’s a statistic to see which web developer role is at the top right now:</p>

<p>To succeed as a web developer, one should have a strong foundation in computer literacy, as well as excellent problem-solving skills and attention to detail. Additionally, it is essential to have a good understanding of the key technologies used in web development, such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Other in-demand skills include Python, HTML, CSS, Java, SQL, NoSQL, C#, Rust, Perl, and Go. The ranking of these skills may vary depending on the specific requirements of the employer.</p>
<p>-Python, C, and Java are some of the highly ranked IT-specific skills that are not included in my current skill set for web development.<br>
-	Teamwork and collaboration, oral communication, and written communication are some of the highest-ranked general skills not in my current skill set. </p>
<p>Improving these skills can enhance my chances of success in my future career as a web developer.<br> Here is a diagram that shows what General skills are in demand:</p>

<p>looking at the Burning Glass data and other sources have not changed my opinion but grew my curiosity even more and shows that I have much to learn and a long way to go before I can fully become web developer in the following years.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">IT CADET – Katya De Francesch</h3>
<p>This job wasn’t listed specifically in any of the burning glass data/other websites, but it does sound most similar to Service Desk Analyst (maybe an entry level version of that) which was ranked number 5 on Burning Glass Data’s top IT job titles.</p>
<p>Burning Glass Data’s Top 3 IT Skills are SQL, JavaScript and JAVA which my ideal job doesn’t require. My job does specify needing experience with MS Suite which was ranked number 5 on this list. </p>
<p>Burning Glass Data’s top 3 generic skills are communication skills, problem solving skills and organisational skills. My ideal job requires all of these as you are working with customers and other people within the bank. The job is based on solving people’s technical problems and I would assume all jobs require some form of organisation as you need to be able to organise your own workload and make sure you’re completing tasks in a timely manner. The highest ranked 3 generic skills that my ideal job does not require are writing, creativity (no designing etc involved) and leadership (entry level job).  </p>
<p>After looking at the burning glass data I was surprised that service desk analyst would be ranked so high. The data has solidified my desire to go into this line of work as the generic skills it requires are amongst the highest ranked in the list and are skills that I already possess due to my current work as a manager at a dental clinic. My concern is that I wouldn’t be using many of the highly ranked IT skills so I’m not sure how much I would really learn in this job.</p>

<h1 style="background-color:yellow;">4.IT Work (Individual members reports with links etc)</h1>
<h3 style="background-color:red;">Clinton Jenkins - ICT Manager </h3>
<p>The kind of work done by an ICT Manager varies depending on how big the company is, whether there are other IT workers underneath this role. Generally, they are responsible for all day-to-day IT operations. They maintain, monitor, service and upgrade all sections of a company's IT related infrastructure. While also supporting and managing IT security.  </p>
<p>An ICT Manager ensures a company's successful future and its demand for scalability when upgrading its IT systems. Working with the financial team of a company to keep its IT systems up to date, working out an annual budget, developing cost effective tenders to upgrade a company's tech and submitting these to the appropriate heads of department.  </p>
<p>They are also responsible for all end users of an organisation, creating their login accounts, work emails, setting up their desk with all their required communication devices and displays. AV and media tech equipment for meeting/board rooms (i.e., Projectors with sound etc). </p>
<p>The ICT Manager must interact with everyone in the office. From delegating tasks to subordinates below them, to communicating with all non-IT related staff regarding any troubleshooting issues they may be suffering at the time. They also deal with all IT-related service providers (i.e., Phones, Internet, Cloud networking subscription services, etc). </p>
<p>The ICT Manager will spend a great deal of time at their desk if they’re lucky enough they could even have remote access to majority of a company's infrastructure. Thus, only requiring to be face-to-face for more upfront hands-on type jobs. </p>
<p>Some of their most challenging aspects include prioritizing of incoming day-to-day troubleshooting problems all the while trying to keep up with all other day-to-day maintenance of a company's IT infrastructure.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">Katya - Help desk technician</h3>
<p>A typical day begins with logging in and setting up all of their programs for the day, they are responsible for the support of many systems. I always have at least ten different applications open. They are assigned to take either calls or chats. The work that is done daily is broad. E.g. password resets, how-to’s, break/fix, uninstall/reinstalls or escalations for larger issues as needed.  Their main challenges are content. Working in a support center that handles several different applications can be overwhelming. It takes time to master each app. The learning is continuous. As systems in the company change, new bugs appear. It can be challenging to stay updated.  </p>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">QA tester at Silverchip (software development company):</h3>
<p>They work from home sometimes and sometimes go to the office. A day usually involves catching up on e-mails, looking through reports to prioritise the day. On Mondays they have a stand-up meting to see if any developers have issues or any blockers that need testing after campaign. After checking through the geo board, they work from, any urgent or high priority tickets will be tackled. They also need to check on project deadlines coming up and those will be worked on also. They make sure any work that the developers have is completed and is working as expected from the point of view of an end user for the site making sure there are no issues with functionality/designs/user experience on the site. This is done by working through a predefined acceptance criteria if working on a support ticket or based on the ticket description or project specification if working on a project. </p>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">QA tester: </h3>
<p>The first task of the day is to check if the build and the deploy of the application went well, without any issues or errors. Sometimes they run their builds and deployment by themselves, depending about the builds. The second task of the day is reading emails (bug reports, documentation). From those emails and bug reports, it is determined what is a priority to test. Every task that is assigned needs to be done according in order of priority. Meetings occur daily, and discussions about issues and bug reports are part of daily routine. One of the biggest challenges of a QA tester is not having enough time. You can find many bugs in a full day of testing just one part of an app and become occupied trying to fix it. Another challenge is communicating to the developers why you think a real user is going to behave in a way that is different from what they’ve pictured.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">Software engineer at SoapBox Labs:</h3>
<p>The day starts with checking emails and reviewing monitoring tooling to ensure the Web Services are running smoothly and all the regions are functioning and serving traffic as intended. There are Product-Developer team stand-ups every morning. Then the majority of the day is spent coding (Python, C++, Javascript, Kubernetes, Azure), monitoring, and/or testing (making sure every system is functioning well).  </p>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">Software engineer: </h3>
<p>The day starts with logging into the projects they’re working on, checking their status and planning the day. This also includes supporting other team members or doing code-reviews. In the morning, teams usually have their daily stand-ups, where the progress of the projects are discussed, including any issues that need solving. A big challenge is trying to reach perfection whilst also being realistic. Trying to be perfect can lead to working too many hours trying to tweak things no one else would notice.  </p>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">Data scientist: </h3>
<p>typical day usually includes meetings with the analytics team to discuss the tasks of the day and brainstorm for possible solutions. Then they will start working on the data. Analysing data consists of three main tasks: gathering the data, cleaning the data, and finally processing the data. Gathering data is usually the easiest part. Cleaning the data means going through the data and trying to understand it, making corrections where needed such as moving outliers or data that should not be included. This step can take a lot of time, but understanding the data is crucial to start processing it. The data processing part is where you use programming skills to analyse the work and come up with solutions for the problem.  </p>

<h1 style="background-color:yellow;">5.IT Technologies</h1>
<h3 style="background-color:red;">Clinton Jenkins – Raspberry Pi/Adruino </h3>
<p>What does it do? (600 words) What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible? </p>
<p>Raspberry Pi/Arduino are a type of single board computer (SBC). Originally designed to be a low-cost and simple open-source educational tool, they have expanded to a consumer market including industry hobbyists, prototype builders, gamers and the generally curious population with a huge variety of project applications with sensors and expansion boards. They also support a variety of operating systems and peripherals. <br>
These low-cost computers introduced and paved the way for General Purpose Input-Output (GPIO) connection pins allowing it to be programmed for a vast range of different electronic components. Some of these components allow access to the internet for IoT based applications, others allow for customisable smart home solutions. </p>
<p>With a vast variety of expansion boards and sensors available the possibilities for an available low-cost solution for everyday projects. Some of the basic projects you can add to your smart home setup include but not limited to a smart light RGB LED light, door and window switch alarm, fire alarm/flame or Co2 alarms, temperature and humidity monitoring, light detection, water detection, soil moisture detection, infrared motion detection with intruder alarm. All these sensors can be programmed to log data, to notify/alert its user of certain scenes and automation algorithms and even connect to the IoT and receive alerts and updates direct to all devices.<br>
The technological developments that can be attained using Raspberry Pi devices in the near future is only limited by the user who builds the product.  </p>
<p> What is the likely impact? (300 words) What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</p>
<p>The impact so far has already made a huge effect on the IT industry. What started as a cheap educational alternative tool exploded into the interests of many stereotypical groups, including but not limited to hobbyists, electronic enthusiasts, smart home automation and even open source medical equipment.  </p>
<p>With the further development of this technology, the possibilities are limitless. With machine learning and algorithms in place the capabilities are endless. The people to be most affected by this industrial boom will be those working directly in the IT industry, seeing everything first hand with just keeping in the know and up to date. This sort of technology wont be phasing out any time soon, if anything it will only modify itself, but its advancing in being the smallest, the fastest will continue. There’s only more jobs that can be created from the advancement of this technology. </p>
<p>How will this affect you? (300 words) In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends? </p>
<p>For me directly, I plan to apply several types of these devices around my home to build my own meshed home network. To be able to pick up the transmission coming from my CGM sensor and to be able to apply more emergency alerts to everyday items around the house. I don’t want to be limited to only receiving alerts from my smartphone, I want to ceiling light to flicker/alert me if I’m having a low while I’m asleep. I’d like other devices around the house to also be able to alert of my current blood sugar level.<br>
With the fear of experiencing low blood sugar levels, this can affect how well a diabetics overall self management of their condition is treated. By taking out the anxiety of always being limited by my blood sugar levels, I can free up more time to improve the rest of my overall quality-of-life. </p>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">What is Cybersecurity?</h3>
<p>Cybersecurity is an increasingly important issue in today’s digital world. Our lives are becoming increasingly intertwined with technology, from our banking and shopping needs to how we communicate with each other.

<h3 style="background-color:red;">Kiran Ross – Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
<h3 style="background-color:red;">What does it do?</h3>
<p>Autonomous vehicles, also known as self-driving cars, are vehicles that are able to navigate and drive themselves without the need for human input. These vehicles are equipped with a variety of sensors and technologies, such as lidar, radar, and cameras, which allow them to perceive their surroundings and make decisions about how to navigate through it. </p>
<p>The state of the art of autonomous vehicle technology is constantly evolving, and significant progress has been made in recent years. Currently, autonomous vehicles can perform a wide range of tasks, including driving on highways, navigating city streets, and handling complex traffic scenarios. However, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed before autonomous vehicles can be widely deployed, such as ensuring that they can safely and reliably handle all types of weather conditions and road surfaces. </p>
<p>There are several companies and organizations that are actively working on the development of autonomous vehicles, including major automakers, tech companies, and research institutions. Many of these organizations are already testing autonomous vehicles on public roads, and some have even begun offering limited autonomous ride-hailing services in select cities. </p>
<p>In the next 3 years, it is likely that we will see significant progress in the development of autonomous vehicle technology. Many experts believe that it is only a matter of time before autonomous vehicles are able to operate safely and reliably in a wide range of environments, including both urban and rural areas. In addition, it is expected that the cost of autonomous vehicle technology will continue to decrease as it becomes more widespread, making it more accessible to a wider range of consumers. </p>
<p>There are a few technological developments that have made the development of autonomous vehicles possible. One of the most important is the advancement of sensors and perception systems, which allow the vehicle to "see" and understand its surroundings. This includes lidar, which uses lasers to create a 3D map of the environment, and radar, which uses radio waves to detect objects and measure their distance from the vehicle. Other key technologies include high-performance computing systems, which are used to process the vast amounts of data generated by the vehicle's sensors, and machine learning algorithms, which allow the vehicle to improve its performance over time by learning from its experiences. </p>
<p>In addition to technological developments, there are several and forever evolving regulatory and policy issues that need to be addressed in order to facilitate the deployment of autonomous vehicles. This includes the development of safety standards and testing protocols, as well as the creation of policies around liability and insurance. As these issues are addressed and resolved, it is likely that we will see a rapid increase in the deployment of autonomous vehicles on public roads. </p>
<h3 style="background-color:red;">What is the likely impact?</h3>
<p>The potential impact of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is significant and multifaceted. AVs have the potential to significantly reduce the number of traffic accidents, as they are not subject to distractions, impairment, or fatigue, which are major causes of accidents involving human drivers. This could save thousands of lives and reduce the economic costs associated with accidents, such as insurance premiums, healthcare expenses, and lost productivity. </p>
<p>AVs could also improve mobility for people who are unable to drive, such as the elderly and those with disabilities, by providing them with a reliable and accessible transportation option. In addition, AVs could potentially reduce the need for people to own their own vehicles, which could lead to reduced traffic congestion and improved air quality in cities. </p>
<p>On the economic front, the deployment of AVs could lead to job losses in the transportation industry, as truck drivers, taxi drivers, and other professional drivers may be replaced by AVs. However, the deployment of AVs is also likely to create new jobs in fields such as AV manufacturing, maintenance, and operation. </p>
<p>AVs may also lead to the proliferation of new technologies and business models, such as the development of shared AV fleets or the integration of AVs into ride-hailing or delivery services. AVs could also potentially enable the use of smaller, more efficient vehicles for certain types of trips, which could further reduce the environmental impact of transportation. </p>
<p>Overall, the impact of AVs is likely to be felt most significantly by people who work in the transportation industry and by those who rely on driving as a primary means of transportation. The extent to which AVs will create, replace, or make redundant current jobs and technologies will depend on the speed at which AV technology is adopted and the way in which it is integrated into society. </p>
<h3 style="background-color:red;">How will this affect you?</h3>
<p>On a personal level I do not expect AV to affect me massively on a day-to-day basis. I may see AV adopted as a normal way over day-to-day transportation, I may see it being used as a delivery method on trucks and delivery vehicles to work however where my job and my living situation will be very minimally affected. I look forward to the development of AV as I do enjoy the motorsport industry and I am excited to see what kind of job opportunities this technology can produce. </p>
<p>As for affecting friends and family, I can see if being beneficial for the elderly members of my family. If transportation becomes more efficient and so efficient to the point where my family members will not have to think to drive, the world will feel like a much smaller place, and it will positively impact my interpersonal relationships with them. </p>

Choosing the right pricing model is as important choosing the right language model as performance has a cost.<br>
OpenAPI is available on Microsoft Azure (Cloud platform).<br>
Usage quotas are based on Tokens. A token is word piece used to process natural language. “For English text, 1 token is approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words. As a point of reference, the collected works of Shakespeare are about 900,000 words or 1.2M tokens.” </P>
<h3 style="background-color:red;">Issues with Scalability and large language AI models</h3>
<p>Scalability issues are not just with how many GPUs (parallel processors) one can cluster but also the ability of data transfer rates (after training on all that data – the models need to be transferred back – to allow access to APIs) between systems, which is limited to about 800 Gps today with interconnects. </P>
<p>“I don’t know if the proposed 800Gbps will be enough to solve this problem as the models are coming with trillions upon trillions of parameters.” Professor Mark Parsons, director of EPCC, the supercomputing centre at the University of Edinburgh. </P>
<p>https://techmonitor.ai/technology/ai-and-automation/chatgpt-ai-compute-power </P>
<p>What this means for our project is we would need to be very aware of data transfer rates IOPs and costs. While we would be re-using the pre-built language models, these AI language models are likey very data intensive even if we are not generating the models from scratch. A lot of prototyping initially should give us an idea of what decent performance looks like and costs it incurs. </P>
<h3 style="background-color:red;">Microsoft Azure</h3>
<p>Can be used to host servers or serverless scripting for the AI bots (This would be where our group would host the python (or other scripting) that runs our AI interface).<br>
Data storage for the hosted script UI/Interfaces can be broken into shards (a way to manage large data sets and control costs by splitting data into separate ‘warehouse’ units. This is something required when data storage gets large but individual clients or databases themselves do not require or justify separate DBMS systems. Sharing it is a way to scale out databases. </P>
<p>While initial datasets might seem small, chat AIs work on remembering previous conversations. This data won’t be stored by OpenAI through their API – we would need a place to store it for the end-user so their AI assistance can build up a profile over time. I estimate this could get quite large (I’m not sure if there’s pruning or other features allowed in this model to shrink the datasets used – I'd need to do a lot more research). </P>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">Other major cloud hosting platforms:</h3>
<p>Google’s Cloud platform uses DeepMind (a different AI platform to OpenAI).<br>
AWS currently does not have a ‘deep learning’ platform like DeepMind or OpenAI<br>
While AWS does have a ML (Machine Learning) service, it doesn’t have a Large Language Model AI out-of-the-box API for people to tap. People would need to build their own ML models from scratch which may suit some big companies but it’s not something off-the-shelf which would suit our project. </P>

<h3 style="background-color:red;">5. Skills – Marketing, technical writers, programmers, system managers, lawyers</h3>
<p>Developing a personal AI assistant requires a strong understanding of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This includes knowledge of natural language processing, computer vision, and other AI technologies that are used to create an intelligent and responsive assistant. Data scientists and machine learning engineers play a key role in developing and training the AI algorithms that power the assistant. </P>
<p>Another important skill is user experience (UX) design. A good personal AI assistant should be easy to use and understand, with a clear and intuitive interface. UX designers are responsible for creating the overall look and feel of the assistant, as well as ensuring that it is easy to navigate and use. They also conduct user research to understand how people interact with the assistant and use that information to improve the design. </P>
<p>Additionally, it is important to have an interdisciplinary team that includes experts in fields such as psychology, sociology, and human-computer interaction (HCI) to understand human behaviour and how people interact with AI assistants. This will help to create an AI assistant that is more responsive and intuitive, and that users will find useful and engaging. </P>
<p>In terms of technical skills, a personal AI assistant requires a strong foundation in software engineering, including knowledge of programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++. Knowledge of cloud computing platforms is also essential for building, deploying and scaling the AI assistant. </p>
<p>As AI and personal assistants are closely related to personal data, it is also important to have experts in data privacy and security. They are responsible for ensuring that the personal data of users is protected and that the assistant complies with relevant laws and regulations. </p>
<p>Overall, developing a personal AI assistant requires a wide range of skills and expertise, and a team that includes professionals from various backgrounds including marketing, technical writing, programming, systems management, law, data science, machine learning, user experience design, psychology, sociology and HCI. With the right team and skills, it is possible to create an intelligent and responsive personal AI assistant that is useful and easy to use for the target audience. </p>
<h3 style="background-color:red;">Skill sets required-Clinton Jenkins</h3>
<p>The Skills required to build and maintain an AI personal assistant application would require a few programming languages including but not limited too C++, Python, Java. We will also require team members skilled in a variety of areas from deep learning algorithms, shell scripting, cluster analysis, neural network architecture, big data and distributed computing, to signal processing techniques.<br>
Many of these skills can be learned through advanced education courses in data science or computer science electives. </p>
